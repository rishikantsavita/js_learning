    <h3>Q - What is a javascript ?</h3>
    <p>Ans - JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that is widely used in web development. It allows
        developers to create interactive effects within web browsers. JavaScript enables features like updating content
        dynamically, handling user input, creating animations, and making asynchronous requests to servers. It is one of
        the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>javascipt is a programming language primarily used to create interactive effects and functions in websites </p>

    <h3>what is variables ? </h3>
    <p>Ans . variables is container for store data. generally there are 3 types of variables Let Const and var modern
        use in Let and const </p>

    <h5>1Ô∏è‚É£ var (Old Method, Avoid Using)</h5>
    <p>üîπ Variables declared with var are function-scoped and can be redeclared.
        üö® Problem with var: It allows accidental redeclaration and can cause bugs.
    </p>

    <h5>2Ô∏è‚É£ let (Modern, Recommended)</h5>
    <p> üîπ let is block-scoped (only exists inside {} where it's declared).
        üîπ It cannot be redeclared in the same scope, preventing errors.
        üîπ Hoisting happens, but it's not initialized before declaration.
    </p>

    <h5>3Ô∏è‚É£ const (For Constants, Cannot Be Changed)</h5>
    <p> üîπ const is block-scoped (like let).
        üîπ Must be initialized at the time of declaration.
        üîπ Cannot be reassigned or redeclared.‚úÖ Use const when the value should never change (like configuration
        settings).
    </p>

        <strong>Key Differences Between var, let, and const</strong><br>
        Feature - var - let - const <br>
        Scope - Function-scoped - Block-scoped - Block-scoped <br>
        Hoisting - Yes (initialized as undefined) - Yes (but not initialized) - Yes (but not initialized) <br>
        Redeclaration - ‚úÖ Allowed - ‚ùå Not allowed - ‚ùå Not allowed <br>
        Reassignment - ‚úÖ Allowed - ‚úÖ Allowed - ‚ùå Not allowed <br>
        Must Initialize? - ‚ùå No - ‚ùå No - ‚úÖ Yes <br>
        ‚úÖ Use let when the variable may change.
        ‚úÖ Use const when the variable should never change.
        ‚ùå Avoid var unless working with old JavaScript code.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Hoisting in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>holded this topic</p>

    <h3>Naming Rules in JavaScript. </h3>
    <p>1. Allowed Characters and Rules
        Can include: Letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).
        Cannot start with a digit (0-9).
        Case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different).
        Cannot use reserved keywords (e.g., let, const, function, etc.).
        2. Best Practices for Naming Variables
        ‚úÖ Use camelCase for variables and functions:
        ‚úÖ Use PascalCase for classes and constructors:
        ‚úÖ Use UPPER_CASE for constants:
        ‚úÖ Be descriptive and meaningful:

    <h3>what is scope </h3>
    <p>Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables. javaScript variables have 3 types of scope:
        1. Block scope
        2. Function scope
        3. Global scope
    </p>

    <h3>What is Variable Scope ? </h3>
    <p>Variable scope determines where a variable can be accessed or used in your code. In JavaScript, there are three
        main types of scope:
        1. Global Scope , 2. Function (Local) Scope , 3. Block Scope (let and const) , 4. Lexical Scope (Closures) </p>
    <p> <strong>Quick Summary</strong> <br>
        <strong>Scope Type -- Can be accessed where? -- Declared using</strong> <br>
        Global Scope -- Anywhere in the script -- var, let, const <br>
        Function Scope -- Only inside the function -- var, let, const <br>
        Block Scope -- Only inside {} (if, for, while, etc.) -- let, const (NOT var) <br>
        Lexical Scope -- Inner functions can access outer variables -- Function closures <br>
    </p>

    <h3>What is a Data Type in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>Data type refers to the type of data that a JavaScript variable can hold. There are seven primitive data types in
        JavaScript (Number, BigInt, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined and Symbol). Objects are non-primitives.</p>

    <h5>1.Primitive Data Types (Immutable & stored by value)</h5>
    <p><strong>Data Type -- Example -- Description</strong> <br>
        Number -- 42, 3.14, -7 -- Any number (integer or floating-point) <br>
        String -- "Hello", 'World' -- A sequence of characters <br>
        Boolean -- true, false -- Represents logical values Booleans are commonly used in conditional statements (if,
        else, while, etc.) to determine whether a block of code should execute.<br>
        Undefined -- let x; -- A variable declared but not assigned a value <br>
        Null -- let y = null; -- Represents "nothing" or an empty value <br>
        Symbol (ES6) -- Symbol('id') -- Unique, immutable identifier <br>
        BigInt (ES11) -- BigInt(1234567890123456789n) -- Large integers beyond Number limits
    </p>
    <h5>2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types</h5>
    <p>Non-primitive data types store complex values and are stored by reference in memory. <br>
        Data Type - Example - Description <br>
        Object - {name: "John", age: 30} - Collection of key-value pairs <br>
        Array - [1, 2, 3, 4] - Ordered list of values <br>
        Function - function greet() {} - A block of reusable code
    </p>
    <h5>Key Differences: Primitive vs. Non-Primitive</h5>
    <p>Feature - Primitive Data Type - Non-Primitive Data Type <br>
        Storage - Stored by value - Stored by reference <br>
        Mutability - Immutable (cannot be changed) - Mutable (can be changed)<br>
        Example - let x = 5; - let obj = {name: "Alice"}; <br>
        Copying - Creates a separate copy - Copies only the reference
    </p>

    <h3>Object in JavaScript</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbol) and values can be
        of any data type, including other objects, arrays, and functions.
